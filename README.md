# SimpleEncrypt

## Description
Created SimpleEncrypt, a user-friendly encryption tool that implements Caesar, Vigenère, and Affine ciphers, allowing users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages. This project showcases my dedication to understanding cryptography principles and implementing secure solutions in Python.

## Features
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shift characters by a fixed number of positions.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Use a keyword to encrypt messages with varying shifts.
- **Affine Cipher**: Apply a mathematical function for encryption and decryption.

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to project directory:
    cd SimpleEncrypt

3. Run the program:
   python simple_encrypt.py

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt messages.
